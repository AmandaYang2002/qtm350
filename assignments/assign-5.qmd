```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('wdi.csv')
print(df.head())
```

The wdi.csv dataset was sourced from the World Development Indicators dataset. My analysis of this is further supported by the following datasets: the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy) @who2023, the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/LUR@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) @imf2023.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| label: tab-summary-statistics

df[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'unemployment_rate']].describe()
```

Table @tbl:tab-summary-statistics summarizes the key statistics for GDP per capita, life expectancy, and unemployment rate.

The summary statistics of GDP per capita, life expectancy, and unemployment rate highlight significant disparities across countries. The GDP per capita has a wide range, from $259 to over $240,000, with an average of $20,345 and a high standard deviation of $31,309, indicating large economic inequality between countries. The 75th percentile is $25,982, showing that only 25% of countries have higher economic output per person.

Life expectancy is relatively more consistent, with an average of 72.42 years and a narrower range between 53 and 85 years. The median life expectancy is 73.51 years, suggesting that most countries fall within a typical range for longevity.

In contrast, the unemployment rate shows significant variation, with a mean of 7.27% and a standard deviation of 5.83%. The lowest unemployment rate is 0.13%, while the highest reaches 37.85%, reflecting considerable differences in labor market conditions. The 75th percentile is 9.46%, indicating that in 25% of countries, unemployment is a major issue.

# Visualizations of Key Indicators

## 1. Bar Chart: GDP per Capita Across Countries

Below is a bar chart showing the GDP per capita for all countries.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Bar chart showing the GDP per capita for all countries. Data from WDI."
#| fig-alt: "Bar chart of GDP per capita for all countries."
#| label: fig-gdp-bar-chart

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot distribution of GDP per capita
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.histplot(df['gdp_per_capita'].dropna(), kde=True, bins=30, color='blue')
plt.title('Distribution of GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

As shown in Figure @fig-gdp-bar-chart, the distribution of GDP per capita is heavily skewed to the right, with most countries having a relatively low GDP per capita. A few countries have very high GDP per capita values, as seen from the long tail of the distribution.

## 2. Scatterplot: Life Expectancy vs. GDP Per Capita

Below is a scatterplot showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita. Data from WDI."
#| fig-alt: "Scatter plot of life expectancy vs. GDP per capita for all countries."
#| label: fig-life-exp-scatterplot

# Scatter plot between life expectancy and GDP per Capita
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='gdp_per_capita', y='life_expectancy', hue='country', legend=False)
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy')
plt.show()
```

As shown in the Figure @fig-life-exp-scatterplot, there is a positive correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancies. However, this relationship flattens as GDP per capita increases, suggesting diminishing returns on life expectancy beyond a certain level of GDP per capita, corresponding to the life expectancy level among developing states in the world today.

## 3. Barplot: Unemployment across countries

Below is a barplot showing the distribution of the unemployment rate of all countries.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Barplot showing the distribution of the unemployment rate of all countries. Data from WDI."
#| fig-alt: "Barplot of the distribution of the unemployment rate of all countries."
#| label: fig-unemp-bar

# Plot distribution of unemployment rate
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.histplot(df['unemployment_rate'].dropna(), kde=True, bins=30, color='green')
plt.title('Distribution of Unemployment Rate')
plt.xlabel('Unemployment Rate (%)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

As shown in the Figure @fig-unemp-bar, the unemployment rate distribution shows that most countries have an unemployment rate between 0% and 15%. A smaller number of countries have higher unemployment rates, with a few exceeding 25%. The data is right-skewed.

## Below is a table that highlights some key statistics from my analysis on GDP per capita, life expectancy and unemployment.

| Indicator           | Mean       | Min      | Max        | Median (50%) | Std Dev   |
|:--------------------|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|-------------:|----------:|
| GDP per Capita      | 20,345.71  | 259.03   | 240,862.18 | 7,587.59     | 31,308.94 |
| Life Expectancy     | 72.42      | 52.99    | 85.38      | 73.51        | 7.71      |
| Unemployment Rate   | 7.27       | 0.13     | 37.85      | 5.54         | 5.83      |
