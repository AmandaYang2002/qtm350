    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will show your understanding of basic Python data and control structures. The questions are designed to test your understanding of the material covered in the previous lecture. Feel free to use any resources available to you to complete this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, should you have any questions, please let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which of the following are valid Python variable names, and why: `_data`, `2nd_value`, `myVar`, `class`, `t0T4L-4M0UnT`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`_data` and `myVar` are valid Python variable names. Variable names cannot start with a number, so `2nd_value` is invalid. `class` is a reserved keyword in Python, so it cannot be used as a variable name. Variable names cannot contain special characters like `-`, so `t0T4L-4M0UnT` is invalid. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Why does the statement `3 is 3.0` return `False` in Python, but `3 == 3.0` returns `True`? What concepts are involved here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `is` operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory, while the `==` operator checks if the values of the two variables are equal. In this case, `3` and `3.0` are different objects in memory, so `3 is 3.0` returns `False`. However, the values of `3` and `3.0` are equal, so `3 == 3.0` returns `True`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Given a string `s = \"DataScienceIsAwesome\"`, write Python expressions to:\n",
    "  - Extract \"Science\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"DataScienceIsAwesome\"\n",
    "science = s[4:11]\n",
    "print(science)  # Output: Science\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - Reverse the entire string\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"DataScienceIsAwesome\"\n",
    "reversed_s = s[::-1]\n",
    "print(reversed_s)  # Output: emosewAsIs ecneicSataD\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - Extract every second character starting from the first character\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"DataScienceIsAwesome\"\n",
    "every_second_char = s[::2]\n",
    "print(every_second_char)  # Output: DtSineIwem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Given a dictionary representing students and their grades:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grades = {\n",
    "    \"Alice\": 90,\n",
    "    \"Bob\": 85,\n",
    "    \"Charlie\": 80,\n",
    "    \"Eve\": 95\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - Add a new student `\"David\"` with a grade of `87`.\n",
    "  - Update `\"Alice\"`'s grade to `95`.\n",
    "  - Remove `\"Charlie\"` from the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add a new student \"David\" with a grade of 87\n",
    "grades[\"David\"] = 87\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update \"Alice\"'s grade to 95\n",
    "grades[\"Alice\"] = 95\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove \"Charlie\" from the dictionary\n",
    "del grades[\"Charlie\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(grades)\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Explain the difference between `//` and `/` operators. Provide an example where the distinction is important and describe a potential error if they are used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `//` and `/` operators in Python are used for division, but they behave differently when the operands are integers. The `//` operator performs floor division, which returns the integer part of the division result. The `/` operator performs true division, which returns a floating-point result.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a Python program that takes the list below and prints each name that contains the letter `a` or `A`. Use a `for` loop and a conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = [\"Andrew\", \"Betty\", \"Charlie\", \"Daniel\", \"Edward\", \"Frank\", \"George\", \"Hannah\", \"Isaac\", \"Jack\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    if 'a' in name.lower():\n",
    "        print(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. _Without running the code_, what will be the value of `x` at the end of the following Python snippet? Explain the order in which operations are performed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "x += x * (x - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of `x` at the end of the snippet will be `25`. The order of operations is as follows: given the initial value of x=5, the expression `x * (x - 1)` evaluates to `5 * (5 - 1) = 20`. Then, the expression `x += 20` is equivalent to `x = x + 20`, which results in `x = 5 + 20 = 25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Given the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lst = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write Python code to:\n",
    "  - Extract the value 4\n",
    "  - Replace the value 7 with 10\n",
    "  - Print the entire modified list\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Extract the value 4\n",
    "value_4 = lst[0][1][1]\n",
    "print(value_4)  # Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replace the value 7 with 10\n",
    "lst[1][1][0] = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the entire modified list\n",
    "print(lst)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. A [ternary expression](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/ternary_operators.html) is a concise way of writing an if-else statement in a single line. Rewrite the following code using a ternary conditional operator:\n",
    "   \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if len(my_list) > 5:\n",
    "    result = \"long\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    result = \"short\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a ternary conditional operator\n",
    "result = \"long\" if len(my_list) > 5 else \"short\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write a list comprehension that generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number and its cube, for all numbers from 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cubes = [(x, x**3) for x in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "print(cubes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will output [(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27), (4, 64), (5, 125), (6, 216), (7, 343), (8, 512), (9, 729), (10, 1000)]."
