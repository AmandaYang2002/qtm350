## Summary

This is a course taught by [Danilo Freire](https://danilofreire.github.io) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu). It introduces essential tools in modern data science, emphasising reliability, reproducibility, and robustness. The curriculum covers command line interfaces, vim, version control with Git and GitHub, and literate programming using Quarto and Jupyter Notebooks. Students will also learn about data storage and manipulation with SQL and Pandas, parallel computing with Dask, AI-assisted programming with GitHub Copilot, and containerisation using Docker.

### Learning objectives

The goals of this course are to provide students with the skills to:

- Use the command line interface to manage files and directories.
- Work with version control systems to track changes in code and collaborate with others.
- Create reproducible reports and presentations.
- Use AI tools to assist with programming tasks.
- Apply advanced techniques for data storage, manipulation, and querying.
- Understand the basics of containerisation and parallel computing.
