# Hello, everyone! üëã {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap of the last lecture {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Introduction to Python üêç

- In the last lecture, we had a brief introduction to Python
- We covered the main concepts of the language, such as variables, operators, control structures, and functions
- We also saw how to install Python and Jupyter Notebook
- We briefly discussed the various data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- We finished with for loops, if statements, and functions
- Today we will see lean more about [Numpy](https://numpy.org) and, more importantly, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

#### What is Numpy?

- NumPy stands for "Numerical Python" and it is the standard Python library used for working with arrays (i.e., vectors & matrices), linear algebra, and other numerical computations 
- NumPy is written in C, making NumPy arrays [faster and more memory efficient than Python lists]{.alert}
- If you have Anaconda installed, you already have NumPy installed too. But if you don't, you can install it using `conda install numpy` or `pip install numpy`
- In Python, we export packages with the `import` command. 
- It is also common to use [aliases](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/modules-in-python) to make the code shorter and more readable. Numpy's is `np`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import numpy as np 
```

#### What is an array?

- Arrays are "n-dimensional" data structures that can contain all the basic Python data types, e.g., floats, integers, strings etc 
- However, they work best with numeric data
- NumPy arrays (`ndarrays`) are homogenous, which means that items in the array should be of the same type. 
- `ndarrays` are also compatible with numpy's vast collection of in-built functions!
