## Office hours: What for and what not for

- What these sessions are meant for:
  - Applying tools in practice
  - Discussion of issues related to the assignments
  - Boosting your knowledge of data science

. . . 

- What these sessions are **not** meant for: 
    - Solving the assignments for you
    - Taking care of developing your coding skills

## Class etiquette

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70%}
- Coding can be tough and push you out of your comfort zone. If the course pace is too fast, let us know. I expect your commitment, but **I do not want anyone to fail.**
- You are all keen on data science, but your backgrounds vary. That is great! Some sessions might be more engaging than others. If you are bored, **help others** or explore new data science areas.
- **Always be respectful** to each other.
- **Ask questions** whenever you need to!

## Cheap computing power

## As a consequence:

::: {.incremental}

- Abundance of data available for research and for governments to make better decisions

    - Opportunities for novel research questions

    - New methods to answer longstanding research questions

- New technologies also have social implications and can raise important policy issues

    - Ethical concerns

    - Use of technology by malicious actors

    - Government use of technology to censor or monitor citizens

# Course Overview and Logistics

## Logistics

- **Syllabus**: Available on [the course website](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/). Our course is centred around [the data science workflow]{.alert}: the terminal, version control, academic/industry publishing, data storage, data management, data visualisation, and containerisation
- **Schedule**: Lectures are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 to 10:15 am. Labs are on Fridays from 9:00 to 10:15 am
- **Office Hours**: I'm available to meet you at any time. [And I mean it!]{.alert} Please reach out a couple of days in advance and we can schedule a meeting

- **Materials**:
    - <https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350/> or <https://github.com/danilofreire/qtm350>
    - Canvas

## Assignments

- **Weekly assignments**: Due on Fridays at 11:59 pm
- **Final project**: Due on the last day of class
- **Grading**: 50% assignments, 50% final project
- **Late policy**: 10% off per day late
- **Collaboration**: You can discuss assignments with your classmates, but you must write your own code and submit your own work
- **Feedback**: I will provide feedback on your assignments and final project. I will also provide feedback on your code and data management practices
- **Academic integrity**: Please refer to the syllabus for the university's policy on academic integrity

# Set up

## Software

- **Git**: Version control system. Download it [here](https://git-scm.com/). Instructions for installation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Feel free to configure it if you wish (instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)), but we are going to talk about it in class.

- **GitHub**: Online platform for hosting code repositories. You will use it a lot, and not only for this class. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and register for a student/educator [discount](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). You will soon receive an invitation to the course organisation on GitHub, as well as [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com), which is how we'll disseminate and submit assignments, receive feedback and grading, etc. 

## OS extras

- **Windows:** Install [Bash for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Another good tutorial can be found [here](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/). You might also want to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (they offer a free and open-source version)
- **Mac:** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- **Linux:** None (you should be good to go)

- More detailed instructions are available on the course website: [https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350-2024/](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350-2024/)

## Next class

- We will start with the basics of the terminal and version control
- Please make sure that you have a terminal installed on your computer
- If you have any questions, please reach out to me
- Recommended readings for the next class are available on the course website: [https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350-2024/](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm350-2024/)
